<p>
	Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,
</p>
<p>
	It's Christmas Day, and time for me to send out all the Blog Secret Santa posts that everyone's written for each other. But I don't have a gift post from you to pass on to <%= @receiver.name %>.
</p>
<p>
	To submit your gift, <%= link_to "login", login_url, target: "_blank" %> and click the "Work on your gift" button.
</p>
<p>
	Hopefully it won't be long before your post will be up and live with all the other gifts.
</p>
<p>
	If you have any questions, just email me back or tweet <a href="http://twitter.com/blogsecretsanta">@blogsecretsanta</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Merry Christmas,
</p>
<p>
	Santa.
