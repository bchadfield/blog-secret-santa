Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

It's Christmas Day, and time for me to send out all the Blog Secret Santa posts that everyone's written for each other. But I don't have a gift post from you to pass on to <%= @receiver.name %>.

It's not too late! To submit your gift, login at <%= login_url %> and click the "Work on your gift" button.

Hopefully it won't be long before your post will be up and live with all the other gifts.

If you have any questions, just email me back or tweet @blogsecretsanta.


Merry Christmas,

Santa.
