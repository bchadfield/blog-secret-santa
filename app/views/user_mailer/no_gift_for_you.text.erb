Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,

*Merry Christmas!*

I've just been delivering all the Secret Santa gift posts to children all around the world, and there's been a terrible glitch in the system.

It seems that your anonymous author has been suffering from writer's block. I'm really sorry about that. We can all struggle with deadlines, though - am I right??

I'm getting in touch with the last few straggling authors, so hopefully I'll have something for you soon.

In the meantime, I hope your Christmas Day offline in the real world makes up for this rather sad email.

Merry Christmas (again),

Santa.
