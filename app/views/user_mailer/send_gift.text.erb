Merry Christmas, <%= @user.name %>!

It's time to unwrap and publish your Secret Santa gift post. I hope it's everything you ever wanted.

A snippet of your post is at the bottom of this email, or you can log in to <%= group_url(@group) %> and pick it up there.

Once you've published this post on your blog log back in and click the "List your gift" button to add the URL. I'll keep an up-to-date list of all the secret posts as they go live, at <%= group_content_index_url(@group) %>.

Have a great Christmas day!

Blog Secret Santa.
